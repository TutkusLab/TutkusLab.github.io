<h2>Ph.D. in New Developments in Advanced Light Microscopy </h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
29th April 2021 - <span style="color: orange"> Opening Soon on 10th May 2021 (Deadline 15th June 2021)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Fellowship in Bioengineering and Robotics, Curriculum Bionanotechnologies
<h3>Description:</h3>
The processes of Life are naturally dynamic in space and time from the molecular to the organismal level. Among the different imaging techniques, light microscopy is the only one that potentially can work across this full scale of biological organisation. Ideally, light microscopy is able to visualise the inner workings of proteins, protein complexes, organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms. However, in practice each specific microscopy techniques poses some fundamental limitations in terms of spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, labelling, invasiveness, and information contents.
The core research of our group (Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy, MMS) is the design, development, and validation of novel optical, biological and computational tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living cells with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, minimal invasiveness, and augmented information content. This goal can be achieved only by working across many disciplines, from physics to engineering, from computer science to biology.

The PhD student will be fully integrated in this general mission and his/her specific project will be design according to his/her background and skills. Current general projects, among which the candidate will contribute, consist in (i) the implementation of super-resolution laser scanning microscopy techniques (e.g., STED and image-scanning microscopy) for deep- and multi-parameter imaging which leverage a unique class of single-photon detector array recently introduce by our group; (ii) the realisation of single-molecule spectroscopy/imaging/tracking architectures which combines nanometre 3D spatial resolution, high-throughput, and ability to quantitatively study the function and structure of different multi-protein machineries/bio-molecules; (iii) the realisation of a wide-field based microscopy technique for large field-of-view and fast imaging based on non-conventional illumination and detection schemes; (iv) design of computational tools in the context of the above projects for improving the imaging quality, and/or reconstruct the finale images, and/or decodes from the dataset the maximum number of specimen information. The PhD student will work in the realisation of these novel methods in order to investigate the most exciting unresolved question from Life sciences. 
The PhD student will benefit significantly from the active collaborations of the MMS group with the several computational and photonics groups of the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia. 
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The project is extremely multi-disciplinary, and it involves many different aspects.

The PhD student will be fully integrated in this general mission and will use the most advanced optical methods and analysis tools developed by the group, and available at the Italian Institute of Technology, to answer fundamental questions for RNA biology and/or neuroscience. As example, our group recently developed a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) technique based a novel single-photon detector array. This novel system allows to implement several FFS techniques (such as spot-variation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, pair-correlation analysis, and image-derived mean squared displacement analysis) combined with different time-resolved spectroscopy method (such as fluorescence lifetime), thus opening to high-information content experiments for deciphering biomolecule dynamics and interactions in living-cell. The group validated the system on test samples, and now is aiming to apply the method to study RNA-based biomolecules and synaptic proteins. A particular attention will be dedicated to question concerning the role of non-coding RNA in gene expression control.
The PhD student will benefit significantly from the active collaborations of the MMS group with the several groups of the LifeTech domain within the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

Optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, for already almost a century, have been the workhorses in the studies of structure and function of cells. However spatiotemporal resolution, labelling, and contrast methods of  conventional microscopy and spectroscopy techniques have some fundamental limitations, that currently hinder the investigation of the smallest and fastest puzzling mysteries of life. Moreover, a large part of the information collected by a microscope is often lost or not taken advantage of. The core research of the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” group is the design, development, and validation of novel optical and analytical tools to break these limitations, and thus, to allow the future biologists to study living cells and organisms with unprecedented temporal-spatial resolutions, minimal invasiveness, and maximal information content.  

As a Postdoc, the successful candidate will implement a custom microscopy architecture for fast, deep and multi-dimensional imaging -- by developing novel optical as well as computational approaches. All the latest tools in a microscope-builders toolbox will be at his/her disposition. In addition to his/her own research, the successful candidate will have the possibility to give his/her contribution to different application projects. Indeed, the developed microscopy architecture will be used both in the context of Life sciences, e.g., for RNA imaging, and in the context of material science, e.g., material-interface imaging.  
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
* Eligible candidates must hold an internationally recognized Ph.D. or equivalent degree (or evidence of its completion in the nearest future) preferably in applied Physics or Bioengineering;
* Strong experiences in optics and microscopy are a must;
* Experience in adaptive optics is highly desirable;
* Coding skills (Python and C#) and expertise in hardware control (FPGA, with LabVIEW) will be considered a plus;
* The ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team are crucial;
* Good English language skill, both spoken and written, is required.
The successful candidate will engage in regular mentoring sessions with the PI, providing opportunities to interact and collaborate with research groups across disciplines, thereby preparing the Postdoc for an independent academic career.

<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Postdoc Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT (www.iit.it) invites qualified level applicants for a Post Doc position at the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” Research Line lead by Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini.

Recent technological advancements in fluorescence microscopy have made it possible to collect rich, multi-parametric data – such as the emission spectra, the excitation spectra, the excited-state lifetime, the polarization, and the photon statistics – of the specimen under investigation, simultaneously, in a single measurement, with a single instrument. As a result, the collected data cannot anymore be considered simply an image, but a multi-dimensional dataset from which one can not only extract the specimen structural information, but functional information as well. Currently, there is a huge lack of analytical methods and algorithms to effectively take advantage of the wealth of information that the current state-of-the-art microscopes collect. As a Postdoc at MMS (IIT) the selected candidate will take charge of developing such methods.
The selected candidate will use different computational tools, including deep/machine learning approaches, to explore this multi-dimensional data and extract more detailed sample structural and functional information. The candidate will work on datasets collected by different microscopy architectures, from super-resolution microscopes to conventional systems, having the possibility to give his/her contribution to many different projects, and at the same time to get a very broad understanding of the data analysis workflows in different microscopy methods and applications.
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Essentials qualifications for this position include a Ph.D. in computer science, physics, engineering, or closely related discipline. Advanced coding skills (Python and C#), abilities in maintaining and sharing code repositories (git), and previous experience with deep learning are highly desirable. The ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team are crucial. Good English language skill, both spoken and written, is required. 
Expertise in microscopy and controlling system will be considered a plus.
