<h2>Fellow Position in Bio-Molecular Dynamics</h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
15th October 2020 - <span style="color: green">Open (Deadline 30th October 2020)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
The Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy (MMS) Research Line of the Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) in Genoa is currently looking for an enthusiastic candidate with a background in the field of Biology, Biotechnology, Biophysics or Bio-engineering for a Fellow position.

The selected candidate will work on a challenging interdisciplinary project to study the dynamics of bio-molecules in live cells. More specifically, the MMS group recently developed a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) technique based on a confocal microscopy setup with a novel SPAD array detector and a multichannel photon time-tagging platform. Several FFS techniques, such as spot-variation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, pair-correlation analysis, and image-derived mean squared displacement analysis, were validated on test samples. The MMS group is now aiming to apply FFS to biological samples. 

The selected candidate will learn the ins and outs of SPAD array based optical microscopy and spectroscopy and, in return, will offer the MMS group biological knowhow and support with the cell experiments. 
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
The position is open in particular to graduated students who want to have a lab experience before applying for a Ph.D. Position, also Bachelor students are encouraged to apply.

<h2>Postdoc Position in Image Processing and Analysis for Fluorescence Microscopy</h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
5th October 2020 - <span style="color: green">Open (Deadline 5th November 2020)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Postdoc Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia - IIT (www.iit.it) invites qualified level applicants for a Post Doc position at the “Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy” Research Line lead by Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini.

Recent technological advancements in fluorescence microscopy have made it possible to collect rich, multi-parametric data – such as the emission spectra, the excitation spectra, the excited-state lifetime, the polarization, and the photon statistics – of the specimen under investigation, simultaneously, in a single measurement, with a single instrument. As a result, the collected data cannot anymore be considered simply an image, but a multi-dimensional dataset from which one can not only extract the specimen structural information, but functional information as well. Currently, there is a huge lack of analytical methods and algorithms to effectively take advantage of the wealth of information that the current state-of-the-art microscopes collect. As a Postdoc at MMS (IIT) the selected candidate will take charge of developing such methods.

The selected candidate will use different computational tools, including deep/machine learning approaches, to explore this multi-dimensional data and extract more detailed sample structural and functional information. The candidate will work on datasets collected by different microscopy architectures, from super-resolution microscopes to conventional systems, having the possibility to give his/her contribution to many different projects, and at the same time to get a very broad understanding of the data analysis workflows in different microscopy methods and applications.
<h3>Requirements:</h3>
Essentials qualifications for this position include a Ph.D. in computer science, physics, engineering, or closely related discipline. Advanced coding skills (Python and C#), abilities in maintaining and sharing code repositories (git), and previous experience with deep learning are highly desirable. The ability and motivation to work independently as well as collaboratively in an interdisciplinary team are crucial. Good English language skill, both spoken and written, is required. 
Expertise in microscopy and controlling system will be considered a plus.
<h3>How to Apply:</h3>
Applications, including detailed Curriculum Vitae, a cover letter, a research statement and name and contacts of 2 referees, must be submitted through the online form at this <a href="https://iit.taleo.net/careersection/ex/jobdetail.ftl?lang=en&job=2000003H"><span style="color:blue">link</span></a>.

<h2>Ph.D. in Advanced Optical Microscopy for Life Science</h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
1st June 2020 - <span style="color: red">Closed (Deadline 15th June 2020)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Fellowship in Bioengineering and Robotics, Curriculum Bionanotechnologies
<h3>Description:</h3>
The processes of Life are naturally dynamic in space and time from the molecular to the organismal level. Among the different imaging techniques, light microscopy is the only one that potentially can work across this full scale of biological organisation. Ideally, light microscopy is able to visualise the inner workings of proteins, protein complexes, organelles, cells, tissues, organs and whole organisms. However, in practice each specific microscopy techniques poses some fundamental limitations in terms of spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, labelling, invasiveness, and information contents.
The core research of our group is the design, development, and validation of novel optical, biological and computational tools that allow the modern biologists to peer inside living cells with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions/ranges, minimal invasiveness, and augmented information content. This goal can be achieved only by working across many disciplines, from physics to engineering, from computer science to biology.
The PhD student will be fully integrated in this general mission and his/her specific project will be design according to his/her background and skills. Current projects consist in (i) the implementation of a novel super resolution laser scanning microscopy technique which leverage a unique single-photon detector array recently introduce by our group; (ii) the optimisation of stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy for live-cell investigation by using the ultimate technologies introduced from different research fields, from labelling protocol to lasers, from detectors to electronic; (iii) the realisation of a new single-molecule spectroscopy/imaging/tracking architecture which combines nanometre 3D spatial resolution, microsecond temporal resolution, ability to quantitatively study the function and structure of different multi-protein machineries/bio-molecules, and high-throughput (iv) design of new computational tools for improving the imaging quality and to decodes from a single experiment the maximum number of information, such as protein copy numbers, and the biomolecule functional changes due to environmental factors.
The PhD student will work in the realisation of these novel methods and/or in their applications to real experimental investigations in order to investigate the most exciting unresolved question from Life sciences. A particular attention will be dedicated to question concerning the role of non-coding RNA in gene expression control.
The PhD student will benefit significantly from the active collaborations of the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group with the several groups of the LifeTech domain within the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.

<h2>Postdoc Position on Image Processing and Analysis for Super-Resolution Microscopy </h2>
<h3>Published:</h3>
15st February 2019 - <span style="color: red">Closed (Deadline 15th March 2020)</span>
<h3>Type of Position:</h3>
Ph.D. Postdoc Fellow
<h3>Description:</h3>
Our group recently introduced a novel single-photon detector array (Castello et al., Nat. Methods, 16, 175–178, 2019) that integrated into a laser-scanning microscope allows measuring the arrival-time and the image-plane position of the detected photons. This ability gives access to a series of novel spatial and temporal dimensions typically discarded/averaged during the microscope image formation process. The candidate will use image deconvolution, deep/machine learning, or other computational tools to explore these new dimensions and achieve better microscopy performances (e.g., information content, and the spatial and temporal resolution/range).

Advanced coding skills (Python and C#), abilities in maintaining and sharing code repositories (Github and Jupyter), and previous experience with deep learning are highly desirable.
