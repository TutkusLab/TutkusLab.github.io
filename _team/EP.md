<h2>ShortBio</h2>
Eleonora Perego studied Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). She got a M. Sc. in Physics in 2015, after a period at the AMOLF Institute(Amsterdam, the Netherlands), working in the group of "Developmental Biology" of Dr. Jeroen van Zon. In 2020 she obtained a PhD in Biophysics, titled "Studying molecular interaction under flow with fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy", working in the group of "Cellular Biophysics" of Prof. Dr. Sarah Koester (Göttingen, Germany), where she studied with fluorescence spectroscopy methods combined with microfluidic approaches protein-protein interactions.

Since 2021, Eleonora is working at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa (Italy) in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini as a post-doctoral researcher. Her research interests include the application of fluorescence spectroscopy methods, such as fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, to biological questions, ranging from neuroscience to RNA biology.
