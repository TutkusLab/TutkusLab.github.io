<h2>ShortBio</h2>

Sabrina Zappone studied Medical Biotechnologies at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy). In 2019, she moved to University of York (York, UK) for a two-month traineeship. She obtained the M.Sc. in 2020 with a thesis entitled “Structural characterization of tardigrade Small Heat Shock Proteins”. Since 2021, Sabrina is a fellow student in Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy group at IIT (Genoa, Italy) under the supervision of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini. Her research interests include the analysis of bio-molecular dynamics, especially those involved in human diseases, using super-resolution microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy tools.
