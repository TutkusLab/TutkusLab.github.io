<h2>ShortBio</h2>
"Not a Physicist. Not an Engineer. All he knows is what he's not. If only he could see what he is." <br/><br/>
Andrea Bucci studied Engineering Physics at Politecnico of Milan (Milano, Italy) and at KTH (Stockholm, Sweden). He got his M.Sc. in 2019 with a thesis entitled "Extended Parallelization of the Illumination in Optical Nanoscopy". After his graduation, he worked for 6 months as a student intern at KAUST.  
Since 2020, Andrea is a PhD student under the supervision of Giuseppe Vicidomini in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy research line at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT, Genoa, Italy). <br/>
His research interests include the design, realization and characterization of optical bioimaging methods with a special focus on smart data analysis. He also has a crush for simulations and analytical models.
