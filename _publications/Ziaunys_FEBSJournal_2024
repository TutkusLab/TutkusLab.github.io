<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Protein liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a rapidly emerging field of study on biomolecular condensate formation. In recent years, this phenomenon has been implicated in the process of amyloid fibril formation, serving as an intermediate step between the native protein transition into their aggregated state. The formation of fibrils via LLPS has been demonstrated for a number of proteins related to neurodegenerative disorders, as well as other amyloidoses. Despite the surge in amyloid-related LLPS studies, the influence of protein condensate formation on the end-point fibril characteristics is still far from fully understood. In this work, we compare alpha-synuclein aggregation under different conditions, which promote or negate its LLPS and examine the differences between the formed aggregates. We show that alpha-synuclein phase separation generates a wide variety of assemblies with distinct secondary structures and morphologies. The LLPS-induced structures also possess higher levels of toxicity to cells, indicating that biomolecular condensate formation may be a critical step in the appearance of disease-related fibril variants.
