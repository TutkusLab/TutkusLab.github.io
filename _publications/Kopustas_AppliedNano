<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Protein-DNA interactions are the core of the cell’s molecular machinery. For a long time, conventional biochemical methods served as a powerful investigatory basis of protein-DNA interactions and target search mechanisms. Currently single-molecule (SM) techniques have emerged as a complementary tool for studying these interactions and have revealed plenty of previously obscured mechanistic details. In comparison to the traditional ones, SM methods allow direct monitoring of individual biomolecules. Therefore, SM methods reveal reactions that are otherwise hidden by the ensemble averaging observed in conventional bulk-type methods. SM biophysical techniques employing various nanobiotechnology methods for immobilization of studied molecules grant the possibility to monitor individual reaction trajectories of biomolecules. Next-generation in vitro SM biophysics approaches enabling high-throughput studies are characterized by much greater complexity than the ones developed previously. Currently, several high-throughput DNA flow-stretch assays have been published and have shown many benefits for mechanistic target search studies of various DNA-binding proteins, such as CRISPR-Cas, Argonaute, various ATP-fueled helicases and translocases, and others. This review focuses on SM techniques employing surfaceimmobilized and relatively long DNA molecules for studying protein-DNA interaction mechanisms
