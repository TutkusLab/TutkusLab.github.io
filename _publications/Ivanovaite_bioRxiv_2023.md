<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Monitoring of DNA-protein interactions is essential in understanding many biological processes. Proteins must find their target site on a DNA molecule to perform their function, and the mechanisms for target search differ across proteins. Revealing temporal interactions with two target sites, both in Cis and in Trans, is crucial in target search mechanisms studies. Here, we present two single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-based assays to study BfiI-DNA interactions. The first assay, smFRET-based DNA looping assay, detects both “Phi” and “U”-shaped DNA looping events. We modified it to only allow in Trans BfiI-target DNA interactions to improve specificity and reduce limitations in the observation time. Our TIRF microscopy measurements directly observe the on- and off-target binding events and characterize BfiI binding events. Our results show that BfiI binding events last longer on target sites and that the BfiI rarely changes conformations during binding. This newly developed assay could be useful for other two-targets-binding DNA-interacting proteins and could be employed for dsDNA substrate BfiI-PAINT, which is useful for DNA stretch-assays and other super-resolution fluorescence microscopy studies.
