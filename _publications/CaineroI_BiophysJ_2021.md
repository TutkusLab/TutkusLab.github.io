<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Chromatin in the nucleus is organized in functional sites at variable level of compaction. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) can be used to generate three-dimensional super-resolution (SR) imaging of chromatin by changing in phase and in orientation a periodic line illumination pattern. The spatial frequency domain is the natural choice to process SIM raw data and to reconstruct an SR image. Using an alternative approach, we demonstrate that the additional spatial information encoded in the knowledge of the position of the illumination pattern can be efficiently decoded using a generalized version of separation of photon by lifetime tuning (SPLIT) that does not require lifetime measurements. In the resulting SPLIT-SIM, the SR image is obtained by isolating a fraction of the intensity corresponding to the center of the diffraction-limited point spread function. This extends the use of the SPLIT approach from stimulated emission depletion microscopy to SIM. The SPLIT-SIM algorithm is based only on phasor analysis and does not require deconvolution. We show that SPLIT-SIM can be used to generate SR images of chromatin organizational motifs with tunable resolution and can be a valuable tool for the imaging of functional sites in the nucleus.
