<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is the major self-regulatory mechanism of green plants, performed on a molecular level to protect them from an overexcitation during the direct sunlight. It is believed that NPQ becomes available due to conformational dynamics of the light-harvesting photosynthetic complexes and involves a direct participation of carotenoids. In this work, we perform a single-molecule microscopy on major light-harvesting complexes (LHCII) from different Arabidopsis thaliana mutants exhibiting various carotenoid composition. We show how the distinct carotenoids affect the dynamics of the conformational switching between multiple coexisting light-emitting states of LHCII and demonstrate that properties of the quenched conformation are not influenced by the particular carotenoids available in LHCII. We also discuss the possible origin of different conformational states and relate them to the fluorescence decay kinetics observed during the bulk measurements.
