<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Plants have developed multiple self-regulatory mechanisms to efficiently function under varying sunlight conditions. At high light intensities, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is activated on a molecular level, safely dissipating an excess excitation as heat. The exact molecular mechanism for NPQ is still under debate, but it is widely agreed that the direct participation of the carotenoid pigments is involved, one of the proposed candidate being the zeaxanthin. In this work, we performed fluorescence measurements of violaxanthin- and zeaxanthin-enriched major light-harvesting complexes (LHCII), in ensemble and at the single pigmentâ€“protein complex level, where aggregation is prevented by immobilization of LHCIIs onto a surface. We show that a selective enrichment of LHCII with violaxanthin or zeaxanthin affects neither the ability of LHCII to switch into a dissipative conformation nor the maximal level of induced quenching. However, the kinetics of the fluorescence decrease due to aggregation on the timescale of seconds are different, prompting towards a modulatory effect of zeaxanthin in the dynamics of quenching.
