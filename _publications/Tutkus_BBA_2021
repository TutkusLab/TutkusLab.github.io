<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Incorporation of membrane proteins into reconstituted lipid membranes is a common approach for studying their structure and function relationship in a native-like environment. In this work, we investigated fluorescence properties of liposome-reconstituted major light-harvesting complexes of plants (LHCII). By utilizing liposome labelling with the fluorescent dye molecules and single-molecule microscopy techniques, we were able to study truly liposome-reconstituted LHCII and compare them with bulk measurements and liposome-free LHCII aggregates bound to the surface. Our results showed that fluorescence lifetime obtained in bulk and in single liposome measurements were correlated. The fluorescence lifetimes of LHCII were shorter for liposome-free LHCII than for reconstituted LHCII. In the case of liposome-reconstituted LHCII, fluorescence lifetime showed dependence on the protein density reminiscent to concentration quenching. The dependence of fluorescence lifetime of LHCII on the liposome size was not significant. Our results demonstrated that fluorescence quenching can be induced by LHCII â€“ LHCII interactions in reconstituted membranes, most likely occurring via the same mechanism as photoprotective non-photochemical quenching in vivo.
