<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Image scanning microscopy (ISM) can improve the effective spatial resolution of confocal microscopy to its theoretical limit. However, current implementations are not robust or versatile, and are incompatible with fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). We describe an implementation of ISM based on a single-photon detector array that enables super-resolution FLIM and improves multicolor, live-cell and in-depth imaging, thereby paving the way for a massive transition from confocal microscopy to ISM.
