title: "Transmembrane protein studies"
shortd: "The main goal of this work is to gain a better understanding of peripheral light-harvesting complexes' role in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) process under lipid environment. Also, to understand better how does the fluorescence intensity of these complexes are related with their conformational dynamcis. We use single-liposome level time-resolved fluorescence microcopy and LHCII reconstitution into lipid vesicles methods. Also, we are employing ensemble level time-resolved fluorescence temperature-dependence measurements of LHCII in native thylakoids, liposomes and detergent. These experiments allow us to compare role of LHCII in the NPQ process both under native and artificial lipid environment."
