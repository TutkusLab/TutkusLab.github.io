title: "Transmembrane protein studies"
shortd: "We aim to gain a better understanding of peripheral light-harvesting complexes' role in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) process under lipid environment. Also, to understand better how the fluorescence intensity of these complexes is related with their conformational dynamcis. We use single-liposome level fluorescence microcopy and LHCII reconstitution into lipid vesicles methods. Also, we are employing ensemble level time-resolved fluorescence temperature-dependence measurements of LHCII in native thylakoids, liposomes and detergent. These experiments allow us to compare role of LHCII in the NPQ process both under native and artificial lipid environment."

Photosynthesis is the natural process of harvesting, converting, and storing the energy of sunlight. With minor exceptions near hydrothermal vents, deep in the ocean's dark floor, this process provides the energy source for essentially all living things on Earth. Photosynthetic conversion of the energy of sunlight into its chemical form suitable for cellular processes involves a variety of physicochemical mechanism. The conversion starts with the absorption of a photon of sunlight by one of the light-harvesting pigments, followed by an electronic excitation energy transfer to the reaction center (RC). The excitation energy starts an electron transfer process to build up a chemical potential that fuels chemical reactions producing energy-rich complex carbohydrates. Therefore, this process in the excitation's description is known as photochemical quenching (PQ).

<br>

At low light intensities, the quantum efficiency of photosynthesis is near unity, meaning that each of the absorbed photons reaches the RC and drives the electron transfer reactions. At high light intensities, however, the RC by regulation mechanisms that lead to quenching of excess excitation energy in light-harvesting proteins to mitigate oxidative damage. This process as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), however, precise molecular mechanism of these self-regulation abilities from the standpoint of physical sciences.

<br>

As showed by multiple experimental observation these processes depend on variations of the transmembrane ΔpH that correlates with the rate of photochemistry in reaction centres and therefore with the intensity of incoming solar radiation. NPQ manifests itself by a strongly reduced chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence lifetime and by clustering and/or increased energetic interconnectivity of the light-harvesting antenna. It is a common agreement that excitation quenching takes place in a specific pigment-protein complex of the light-harvesting antenna reached by excitation because of the excitation random migration.

We perform studies of surface-tethered antenna complexes either in detergent micelles or in lipid vesicles or in native chloroplasts. To sudy conformational dynamics (fluorescence intensity variation over time) we utilize single-molecule TIRFM microscopy. To study quenching of fluorescence we also add the time-resolved equipment to our measurment set-up and then perform measuremtns in confocal mode. This equipment is available at our department (Molecular Compounds Physics Department at the Center for Physical Sciences and technology) and it is based on a home-built confocal fluorescence microscope set-up. This set-up has several constant-wave lasers, a pulsed red laser, two avalanche photo-detectors and the time-correlated single photon counting card. This microscope also has an automated focus drift correction function, which enables long-lasting stable signal registration.

We reconstitute LHCII in vesicles of native thylakoid lipid mixture supplemented with hydrophobic membrane stain and biotinylated lipids. Next, we immobilize the LHCII vesicles sample on the PEGylated (contains 10% of biotin-PEG) glass coverslips via streptavidin or similar protein. Stable immobilization of these vesicles on streptavidin becomes possible because of biotinylated lipids added to the lipid mixture.

Membrane dye allow us to perform co-localization between antenna complexes (635 nm excitation) and membrane (532 nm excitation) fluorescence channels. Reliable co-localization analysis of fluorescence images becomes possible because antenna complex is not waekly absorbing light at the 532 nm, where membrane dye absorption is maximal. This co-localization strategy helps to discriminate between vesicle-reconstituted and vesicle-free LHCII bound to surface. Also, membrane dye fluorescence intensity allows intensity-based characterization of vesicle size, which is an interesting parameter for antenna complex quenching characterization (e.g. whether LHCII in smaller lipid area are more quenched).

<br>

To compare role of antenna complexes in the non-photochemical quenching process both under native and artificial lipid environment we are performing ensemble level time-resolved fluorescence temperature-dependence measurements of antenna complexes in native thylakoids. We use streak-camera and kryostat for these measurements. The streak-camera reveal wavelength-dependency of LHCII fluorescence lifetime. At the same time, sample is mounted on the kryostat, which enables cooling of the sample to 15 K temperature.

<br>

These xperiments help us to answer the following questions:
a) discriminate vesicle-free/vesicle-reconstituted antenna complexes and estimate antenna complexes reconstitution efficiency.
b) find, if existing, fluorescence kinetics differences between vesicle-reconstituted (aggregates in vesicle membrane) and vesicle-free (aggregates bound to surface) antenna complexes.
c) whether different antenna complexes vesicles (different number of antenna complexes per similar area vesicle or similar antenna complexes number per different vesicle area) has influence on the antenna complexes fluorescence kinetics.
d) whether vesicle size alone (despite number of antenna complexes per vesicle) has an influence on antenna complexes fluorescence kinetics.
e) find differences, if existing, between antenna complexes quenching under native and artificial lipid environment.
