title: "Image Processing and Analysis"
quote: "The job of image restoration is to figure out what the instrument is actually trying to tell you (Prof. Roy Pike)."
shortd: "The aims of this set of projects is to implement computational algorithms able to improve the quality/resolution of a microscopy image/dataset (e.g., via deconvolution), and to extract from it the maximum amount of information, both from the biological (e.g., biomolecules localization/concentration) content and the optical system content (e.g., spatial resolution, optical aberrations)."
