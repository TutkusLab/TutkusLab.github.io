title: "Open microscopy"
shortd: "Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) helped to reveal nanoscale molecular structures and their dynamics. However, it requires state-of-the-art scientific-grade equipment. We developed cost-effective super-resolution microscope solution (approx. 50K Euro) that can perform dual-channel widefield, confocal and TIRF imaging. This project is standing on a base of miCube microscope (approx. 110K Euro)."

We developed the miEye: Bench-top super-resolution microscope with cost-effective equipment. This project TIRF system development and industrial-grade CMOS camera application for such studies. Recently our new set-up was cited (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01313-1?proof=t%29Nature"><span style="color:blue">Nature Methods</span></a>). Also, we are working on Phyton-based microscope control and single-molecule localization microscopy data analysis (SMLM) packages. This project is entitled (<a href="https://github.com/samhitech/microEye"><span style="color:blue">micro Eye</span></a>).
